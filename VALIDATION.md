# VALIDATION.md

Web-front edition (`saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn`, ADR-0028). Everything below distinguishes what was executed
from what was not. Engine, rule and UI validation lives upstream in `saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/VALIDATION.md`.

## core-update runs from main only, and auto-merge ignores the bump job's report (2026-10-31)

What changed: the first step of both jobs refuses a run whose `github.ref` is not `refs/heads/main`, the `pull-request`
job's `if:` also requires it, both checkouts take `github.sha`, and `create-pull-request` gets `base: main`. The
auto-merge step's condition is now `CORE_AUTOMERGE == 'true'`, not a probe, the apply step succeeded and a pull request
number exists; it no longer reads the untrusted outcome.

- **Executed:** `npm ci`; `npm test` — **116 pass, 0 fail**; `node --test tests/security/core-update-app-token.test.mjs`
  — 22 pass, with three new or rewritten tests (the refusal is the first step of each job, has no `if:`, reads the ref
  through `env` and names it in an `::error::`; the `bump` job has no job-level `if:` and the `pull-request` job's
  requires `main`; both checkouts use `github.sha` and the pull request step names `base: main`; the auto-merge
  condition has the variable, the apply step and `!inputs.probe` and nothing that reads the outcome, and only the pull
  request step and a token-free warning read it). `actionlint` 1.7.12 on `core-update.yml`: no findings (shellcheck
  integration off, not installed).
- **Mutation check:** six breakages, each made at least one test fail: the `bump` job's refusal step removed, the
  `pull-request` job's refusal step removed, the `main` condition removed from the job's `if:`, the refusal's `exit 1`
  replaced with `true`, `ref: github.sha` removed from a checkout, and `steps.apply.outputs.outcome == 'success'` added
  back to the auto-merge condition. The workflow was restored byte for byte afterwards.
- **Checked, read-only:** `gh api repos/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/rules/branches/main` shows the active
  "Protect main" ruleset (id 25825144) with a `required_status_checks` rule for `build-test`, `codeql`, `secret-scan`,
  `e2e` and `dependency-review`, which covers what the `bump` job's compatibility check runs (unit tests, build, e2e).
  `peter-evans/create-pull-request` at the pinned commit throws "When the repository is checked out on a commit instead
  of a branch, the 'base' input must be supplied." without `base` (`src/create-pull-request.ts`), hence `base: main`.
- **Not executed:** the workflow on GitHub (neither a scheduled run nor a refused run from a branch); the value of the
  `CORE_AUTOMERGE` variable could not be read from this session.
- **Known limitation:** a manual run takes the workflow file itself from the branch it was started on, so a branch that
  also edits `core-update.yml` can delete these guards. Closing that needs the App key moved to an environment whose
  deployment branches are `main` only (a settings change, not made here).

## core-update in two jobs (2026-10-31)

What changed: `core-update.yml` now has a `bump` job, which installs the new upstream release and runs the tests and e2e
against it with no secret, and a `pull-request` job, which runs none of that code and only then mints the GitHub App
token. The second job rebuilds the bump with `scripts/core-update-pin.mjs` (from the checkout of `main`) and a
lock-only npm install, and refuses the first job's artifact unless its `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are
byte-identical. This repository records ADRs upstream with shared numbering, so this decision is recorded here and in
the pull request rather than under a new ADR number.

- **Environment:** Linux authoring sandbox, Node 22.23.4 (no Node 26 locally), npm 11.20.0 run from its registry tarball
  (sha256 `d1a92f40…a483`, which matches the registry's `sha512-dF3E…Ngw==`), the same npm that the `core-update` run of
  2026-10-27 used on Node 26.12.1 (run 40454829205, the one that opened pull request 54).
- **Executed:** `npm ci`; `npm test` — **114 pass, 0 fail**, including three new or rewritten files:
  `tests/security/core-update-app-token.test.mjs` (static checks of both jobs: no secret and a read-only token in
  `bump`; in `pull-request` no `npm`/`npx` command, `node` only for the pin script and the pinned npm, the lock command
  with every refusal flag, no package-manager cache, the same npm version and hash in both jobs, the token after the
  apply step); `tests/security/core-update-apply.test.mjs` (runs the workflow's own bump, collect and apply steps with a
  stand-in npm; 23 kinds of tampered artifact or regeneration, among them an extra dependency or an install script in
  `package.json`, a changed integrity or resolved URL in the lock, an extra file, a symbolic link and a bad or missing
  outcome, are each refused with the named error, nothing written to the step output and `git status` clean);
  `tests/security/core-update-pin.test.mjs` (the pin script on this repository's own files, hostile tags, and the lock
  check); `tests/security/core-update-tag-shape.test.mjs` unchanged and passing.
- **Mutation check:** 22 deliberate breakages of the workflow (for example `npm test`, `npm ci`, `npx` or the pinned
  npm's `ci` added to the `pull-request` job; `--ignore-scripts`, `--allow-git=none` or `--allow-remote=root` dropped;
  the package-manager cache turned back on; the byte comparison, the artifact listing, the outcome check, the tag check,
  the lock check or `git clean` removed; a token step placed before the apply step; a token given to the compatibility
  step; a different lock command in `bump`; the npm hash check made optional; auto-merge on the outcome alone) each
  made at least one test fail. The workflow was restored and compared byte for byte afterwards.
- **Dry run against a real release:** the tree as it was just before pull request 54 (`756dfb2^`, pinning `v0.4.0`) was
  bumped to `v0.4.1` with `scripts/core-update-pin.mjs` (its `package.json` equals `main`'s byte for byte) and re-locked
  with `npm-cli.js install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --allow-git=none --allow-remote=root --allow-file=none
  --allow-directory=root --no-audit --no-fund --no-update-notifier`, twice, in separate folders with separate npm caches.
  Both locks are byte-identical to each other and to `main`'s `package-lock.json` (the one the real workflow committed in
  pull request 54); npm left `package.json` untouched and created no `node_modules`. The two `v0.4.1` tarballs were
  downloaded again and their SHA-512 equals the lock's `integrity` entries (`sha512-hKnjvlbs…` core,
  `sha512-MQxLdcd2…` ui), so npm records the tarball's own hash. `check-lock` accepts `main`'s lock.
- **Experiment, the lock-only install runs no package code:** with the flags above, a dependency served from a local
  address with `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall` and `prepare` scripts wrote none of their marker files and no
  `node_modules`; without `--ignore-scripts` the project's own `postinstall` ran (npm runs the root project's scripts
  even with `--package-lock-only`, `lib/commands/install.js`); a dependency that pulls a git dependency stopped with
  `EALLOWGIT` and one that pulls another URL with `EALLOWREMOTE`, before any fetch (npm's `pacote` checks these when
  it chooses a fetcher). `--allow-git=none` matters because preparing a git dependency runs `npm install` inside its
  clone (`pacote/lib/git.js`), which `--ignore-scripts` alone does not cover.
- **Checked:** `actionlint` 1.7.12 (release binary, checksum checked) on `core-update.yml`: no findings, with its
  shellcheck integration off because shellcheck is not installed here. The `upload-artifact` (v7.0.2) and
  `download-artifact` (v8.0.2) pins are the commits those tags point at (`git ls-remote`), the same pins the Cloud
  Assessor and NetworkEyes add-ons use; `setup-node` v7.1.0 has the `package-manager-cache` input (its `action.yml` at
  the pinned commit).
- **Not executed:** the two-job workflow on GitHub (it has not run yet, so it has not opened a bump pull request); the
  run on Node 26 (the dry run used Node 22 with the same npm); shellcheck and zizmor (installing them from PyPI was
  refused by this session's safety check); `npm run e2e` (nothing here touches the pane or the API).
- **Known limitation:** the two jobs ask the npm registry separately, minutes apart. If a new upstream release adds a
  dependency and the registry publishes a newer matching version between the two jobs, the locks differ and the
  `pull-request` job refuses; the run fails and a rerun fixes it. That is the safe direction.

## Pane model, 0.3.0 (2026-10-10)

- **Environment:** Linux authoring sandbox, Node 26.11.1 (a local `node@26` on PATH, never system-wide), npm 10.9.4, the sibling
  upstream at `APP_REF` v0.2.1 built and assembled; no Docker daemon.
- **Executed:** `npm run typecheck` (API project and the pane's `tsc -p apps/lab-web/tsconfig.json`); `npm test` — **23 pass,
  0 fail** (13 API tests including framing default vs configured, the flat health envelope, `x-addon-*` on JSON/static/error
  responses, rate limit 429 with `Retry-After` shared by the workspace route, overload 503 with `maxConcurrent: 0`,
  fail-closed verification 503 and the allow flag, start-up refusal without a site key, trust-proxy address selection,
  cache-control per path; 3 two-way OpenAPI contract tests; 4 edition-boundary tests; manifest; no-secrets); `npm run build`
  (API + pane, `apps/lab-web/dist`); **`npm run e2e` — 5 pass** on Chromium 153 (`npx playwright install chromium` succeeded
  here): the journey through the pane, the exact message sequence `loading → ready → working → ready` on a host page with
  the site's sandbox (four messages, none on re-render) plus delete through the sandbox, headers (`frame-ancestors` from env,
  no `x-frame-options`, `x-addon-*`), 403 without a verification token with the explorer's alert, no password inputs, no
  partner or vendor names; a smoke run of `apps/lab-api/dist/server.js` with `AMO_STATIC_DIR=apps/lab-web/dist
  AMO_ALLOW_NO_TURNSTILE=1 AMO_FRAME_ANCESTORS="'self' https://hybridcloudworks.com"`: health answers the flat envelope,
  `/` is `no-cache` with the configured `frame-ancestors` and no `x-frame-options`, `/assets/*` is immutable, the start-up
  warning names the allow flag; all workflow files parse; the `node:26-bookworm-slim` index digest was resolved from Docker
  Hub (`sha256:86f07bc9…`) and is the pin in `Dockerfile.lab` (marked [VERIFY] for the first production publish).
- **Review round 1 (Copilot, PR #4, 2026-10-10), same environment:** `npm run typecheck`; `npm test` — **26 pass, 0 fail**
  (the 23 above plus: the fail-closed 503 is answered before the body is read, with `connection: close`, and a 6 MB upload
  against it is cut or answered within the bound; a secret without a site key refuses to start even with the bypass flag;
  a stalled verification endpoint yields `403 siteverify-timeout` within the bound, holds one of the `maxConcurrent`
  slots so a second request gets `503 overloaded`, and a fetch that ignores the abort signal still times out — in
  `api.test.ts`; `config.test.ts` covers the environment mapping and the refusal of `0`, negative, fractional and
  non-numeric `AMO_RATE_LIMIT_POSTS`, `AMO_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES`, `AMO_MAX_CONCURRENT` and TTL values; the contract test
  checks that every documented response carries the four AddOn header components); `npm run e2e` — **5 pass**;
  `docs/api/openapi.yaml` parses as YAML (PyYAML) with the shared `addon_headers` anchor resolving on all 26 responses.
- **Not executed locally (CI only):** `docker build` of `Dockerfile.lab` and the Trivy scan (no daemon); `publish-images.yml`
  against Docker Hub (the OIDC connection and the `DOCKERHUB_*` variables are owner steps); the website's `addons` role,
  Caddy route and status proxy (Phase 6, website repository); verification against the real siteverify endpoint.
- **Adopted with upstream v0.3.0** (2026-10-11): `partners={false}` replaces the CSS rule that hid the partner panel and
  `contactPath` + `onNavigate` replace the capture-phase click handler that turned the in-frame `/contact` link into a
  `navigate` request. **Still shims:** the pane derives `working`/`ready` from a `fetchImpl` wrapper around the explorer's
  POSTs rather than from `onStageChange` (one signal, already covered by e2e), and bypasses `window.confirm` when
  framed: the site's sandbox has no `allow-modals`, so the browser ignores the explorer's `confirm()` (`Ignored call to
  'confirm()'. The document is sandboxed, and the 'allow-modals' keyword is not set.`, observed in e2e) and "Delete my data
  now" would otherwise do nothing. The UI package should confirm deletion without a modal.
- **Known limitation:** `unavailable` cannot be posted when health itself fails, because the site origins come from health;
  the site's 30-second watchdog shows its own sentence, and the pane shows the same sentence in-frame.

## Flip to the downstream edition (2026-10-04)

- **Environment:** Windows 11, Node 26.5, npm 11.17, Docker Desktop 29.8 (CI targets Node 22 — this run is not evidence for Node 22).
- **Executed:** tree rebuilt from the post-split repositories with imports rewritten to the published packages; `.npmrc` `install-links=true` so the `file:` links are packed and installed like registry packages (their own dependencies included); `npm install` (new lockfile) and `npm ci` clean; `npm test` — **15 pass, 0 fail** (lab API, OpenAPI contract, manifest, no-secrets, rewritten `edition-boundary` against the installed core); harness `vite build` — chunk hashes identical to the pre-flip harness build; `docker build` of `Dockerfile.lab` from the two-tree context → nothing from the upstream tree at runtime, rules found inside `migration-core`, health 200, sample served, no `npm`, containerised Trivy (HIGH/CRITICAL, fixed only) exit 0; all 8 workflow files parse and every action is SHA-pinned; `terraform fmt -check` clean; PowerShell packaging 139 files, no leak.
- **Not executed locally:** Playwright e2e (CI job `e2e`; the first CI attempt failed because npm does not install a symlinked package's dependencies — fixed by `install-links`); `core-update.yml` end to end (no newer upstream release exists yet; trigger it manually with `workflow_dispatch` to rehearse).

## Node 26 runtime floor (2026-10-04, ADR-0029)

- **Executed (Node 26.5 locally):** `npm install` against the upstream packages declaring `engines.node >=26`; `npm test` — 15 pass; harness `vite build`; `docker build` of `Dockerfile.lab` on `node:26-bookworm-slim` → Node 26 at runtime, health 200, containerised Trivy (HIGH/CRITICAL, fixed only) exit 0; workflows parse with `setup-node 26`.
- **Not executed locally:** GitHub-hosted runners on Node 26 and the Playwright e2e (CI); the devcontainer image pull.

## Standing limitations

- Dependency contract (ADR-0030, 2026-10-11): the upstream packages are release tarballs pinned by URL and integrity hash.
  The pin and the lock move together through `core-update.yml`; a hand-edited URL without a re-lock fails `npm ci` on
  purpose. The pin moved `v0.3.0` to `v0.3.1`; both tags and their release assets exist and the lock carries the integrity
  entries. On 2026-10-24 the two `v0.3.1` tarballs were downloaded and their SHA-512 values equal the lock's entries (see
  `docs/whats-new-upstream.md`, which also lists what upstream changed since).
- `core-update` pull requests are opened with a GitHub App token (the HCW Main Admin App: its client ID is the repository variable
  `HCW_MAIN_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`, its private key the repository secret `HCW_MAIN_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`), not
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the required checks (`ci`, `security`) run on the pull request itself; the `core-update` run linked in
  the PR body still gives the compatibility evidence (it decides the `compatible` / `needs-adaptation` label). The token step
  is covered by `tests/security/core-update-app-token.test.mjs` (static) and was linted with actionlint and zizmor in the
  earlier one-job layout, which opened the `v0.4.1` bump (pull request 54). The two-job layout of 2026-10-31 (section
  above) has not run on GitHub yet. To prove the credential without a release to adopt:
  `gh workflow run core-update.yml -R saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn --ref main -f probe=true`.
  The App key lives only as the repository secret `HCW_MAIN_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` and is never printed. To rotate it,
  generate a new private key on the settings page of the App (https://github.com/settings/apps), replace the secret in every repository that holds the key (this one:
  https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/settings/secrets/actions; the App is installed on the four
  add-on repositories, so check the other three), then delete the old key on the settings page of the App.
  The settings page can hold several keys, so a separate key per repository lets you revoke one without
  touching the others.
- Auto-merge of a compatible bump needs the repository setting "Allow auto-merge". It was off on 2026-10-26 (UTC), when
  the run that opened the first bump pull request ended with "Auto merge is not allowed for this repository". It has since been turned on (checked on 2026-10-26 UTC). If it is ever off again, `core-update` warns and leaves the pull request for a person to merge.
- Playwright e2e ran locally on 2026-10-10 (Chromium downloaded) and on GitHub-hosted runners; earlier sandboxes blocked the download.
- The standalone lab Terraform (`infrastructure/terraform/lab-hostinger`, `lab-cloudflare`), the tunnel edge notes
  (`infrastructure/reverse-proxy`) and `docs/deployment/vps.md` were retired on 2026-10-10 and deleted; `iac-validate`
  covers the Coder template only. ADR-0019 stays as the record of the retired edge.
- Human verification against the real siteverify endpoint, the website's `addons` role on the live host, Coder workspace
  creation against a live deployment and the workspace image build were not executed.
