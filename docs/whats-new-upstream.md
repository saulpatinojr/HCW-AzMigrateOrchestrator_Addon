# What's new upstream

The upstream product is [`HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App`](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App). This
edition adopts its release tarballs (`@hybridcloudworks/migration-core` and `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui`) and nothing else.

## How to use this file

Read it before you change behaviour, bump the upstream pin or review a `core-update` pull request: it says what changed
upstream, whether it reaches this edition, and what to run. Add an entry when a change lands upstream that reaches this
edition (the upstream `CLAUDE.md` asks for the same), newest first, and keep the table below true.

## Current upstream state (checked 2026-10-27)

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Upstream `main` | `b9fc763` (merge of upstream pull request #100, the `v0.4.1` release preparation); it is the `v0.4.1` tag commit. Upstream pull request #101, which changes only documents and one Terraform comment (none of it in the tarballs), was open when this was written |
| Latest upstream release | `v0.4.1`, published 2026-10-27, tag commit `b9fc763` (annotated tag) |
| What this edition pins | `v0.4.1` (adopted by [pull request 54](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/pull/54), merged 2026-10-27): `migration-core` and `migration-ui` as release tarballs, by URL in `package.json` and by integrity hash in `package-lock.json` |
| Drift between pin and latest release | None |
| Do the pinned hashes match the published assets? | Yes. The two `v0.4.1` tarballs were downloaded on 2026-10-27 and their SHA-512 values equal the `integrity` entries in `package-lock.json` (`sha512-hKnjvlbs…` for core, `sha512-MQxLdcd2…` for ui) |
| Unreleased upstream changes that touch the tarballs | None. Upstream `main` is the `v0.4.1` tag commit |
| Tags | Upstream has an active ruleset, "Protect release tags", on `v*` tags. It blocks creating, updating and deleting them except for a repository role that can bypass it (the owner's `v0.4.1` tag push reported "Bypassed rule violations"). Before 2026-10-24 the `v0.3.1` tag had been moved once; that release is no longer pinned. The `integrity` hashes in `package-lock.json` would catch a changed file under a pinned tag |

Dates in this file are in US Central time; GitHub shows UTC, so a release can appear a day later there.

How "nothing changed" was checked: `git diff v0.4.0 v0.4.1 -- packages rules scripts/assemble-packages.mjs` upstream lists
only the rule-diff report files `rules/reports/learn-diff.json` and `rules/reports/learn-diff.md`. The core tarball ships only
`rules/azure`, `rules/organization`, `rules/schemas` and `rules/snapshots` (`scripts/assemble-packages.mjs`), and none of those changed.
The extracted `v0.4.0` and `v0.4.1` tarballs differ only in the `version` of both `package.json` files and, in `migration-ui`, the exact `migration-core` version it depends on (107 files in core and 30 in ui, in both releases). Upstream CI on `main` at `b9fc763` passed (the `ci`, `security` and `scanners` runs).

## Entries (newest first)

### 2026-10-27: upstream release `v0.4.1` (the appliance is fixed; the tarballs' contents do not change)

- Upstream release [`v0.4.1`](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/releases/tag/v0.4.1) fixes the **appliance** API, which in `v0.4.0` cannot start against an Azure database (the database library discarded the sign-in token provider), and the appliance's Terraform. Pull requests [98](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/98) (Terraform names and the zone setting) and [99](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/99) (the API's database connection). Pull request [100](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/100) raises the version and adds one more API fix (a repeated option in `DATABASE_URL` is refused). Also in this range, none of it reaching this edition: [95](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/95) (the image-publish workflow), [96](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/96) (a rules report) and [97](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/97) (a Terraform database-subnet setting).
- **Reaches this edition? Only version numbers.** The appliance API (`apps/appliance-api`) and the Terraform are not in the two tarballs, and this edition cannot construct an Azure credential. The extracted `v0.4.0` and `v0.4.1` tarballs differ in nothing but the `version` in both tarballs' `package.json` and, in `migration-ui`, the exact version of `migration-core` it depends on (107 files in core and 30 in ui, in both releases); the file names carry the version too.
- **Action here:** done. The `core-update` [pull request 54](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/pull/54) moved both pins from `v0.4.0` to `v0.4.1` and merged after its required checks passed. The downloaded tarballs' hashes were compared with the lock file (see the table).

### 2026-10-25: upstream release `v0.4.0` (adopted here on 2026-10-26; this entry was added late, on 2026-10-27)

- Upstream release [`v0.4.0`](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/releases/tag/v0.4.0), tagged 2026-10-25. Upstream commits since `v0.3.1` in `packages/`, `rules/` or the assembly script (from `git log v0.3.1..v0.4.0 -- packages rules scripts/assemble-packages.mjs`), split by whether they reach the two tarballs. **They do:** log redaction (JWTs and PEM private keys are hidden, upstream pull request [81](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/81); values are redacted by structure, pull request [90](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/90), a wider security hardening change), the per-cell length cap and the expression and escaping fixes ([88](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/88)), the UI dependency ranges (Radix UI and react-dom, pull requests [29](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/29), [33](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/33), [37](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/37) and [38](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/38)) and the new repository address that the assembly script writes into the tarballs' `package.json` ([68](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/68)). **They do not:** the Entra `nbf` check ([67](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/67)), more refused credential variables ([64](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/64)) and a comment that follows this edition's new name ([70](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/70)), which are in `azure-auth` and `azure-arm`, two packages that are never published (`NEVER_PUBLISHED` in `scripts/assemble-packages.mjs`).
- **Reaches this edition? Yes.** The two behaviours announced in the next two entries (redaction of tokens and private keys in logs; the 65,536-character cell limit and the expression fixes) arrived with this release. It was adopted by [pull request 49](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/pull/49), merged on 2026-10-26 after its `ci` run passed.
- **Action here:** none now. This entry only closes the follow-up the next two entries asked for ("add that release to this file").

### 2026-10-25: the next core release limits one CSV cell to 65,536 characters and fixes slow expressions (upstream pull request 88)

- **Update 2026-10-27:** this arrived with upstream `v0.4.0` (adopted by [pull request 49](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/pull/49) on 2026-10-26); see the `v0.4.0` entry above.
- Upstream [pull request 88](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/88) (ticket [77](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/77)) changes three published modules. (1) `csv-ingestion`: `ingestResourcesCsv()` now skips a row that has a cell longer than 65,536 characters, with a warning that names the row and column, and refuses a file whose header cell is that long. Until now the only limits were the whole upload (5 MB) and the row count (5,000), so one cell could be 5 MB. (2) `terraform-generator`: the function that turns a resource name into a Terraform identifier no longer has a regular expression that a long run of underscores could make very slow. (3) `report-engine`: a backslash in a name or note is now doubled in the Markdown reports so it cannot cancel the escape of a `|` and split a table row.
- **Reaches this edition? Yes, at the next upstream release.** `v0.3.1` still has the old behaviour. This edition's upload path (`apps/lab-api/src/app.ts`) passes only `maxRows` and `maxBytes`, so it gets the new cell limit as the default without a code change. The limits this edition must never weaken (5 MB, 5,000 rows) are untouched. Visible effect for a visitor: a CSV with a 65,537-character cell loses that one row and sees the warning; a normal export is not affected (the longest real value, the tags cell, is about 40,000 characters at most).
- **Action here:** none now. When the `core-update` pull request for the release that carries it arrives, run `npm ci`, `npm test` and `npm run e2e`, and add that release to this file.

### 2026-10-25: the next core release hides sign-in tokens and private keys in logs (upstream pull request 81)

- **Update 2026-10-27:** this arrived with upstream `v0.4.0` (adopted by [pull request 49](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/pull/49) on 2026-10-26); see the `v0.4.0` entry above.
- Upstream [pull request 81](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/81) fixes `redact()` in `@hybridcloudworks/migration-core/observability`, the function that hides secrets before a log line is written. Before, a JWT (a sign-in token that starts `eyJ`) and a PEM private key block were not hidden: the old code kept everything before the first `=` or `:` of the match, and those two have neither, so the token or key stayed in the log with `=[REDACTED]` added after it. Now both are replaced whole with `[REDACTED]`, values such as `password=...` still keep their key name, and the patterns cannot be slowed down by a very long line. The ticket is [upstream issue 77](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/77).
- **Reaches this edition? Yes, at the next upstream release, not before.** `v0.3.1`, which this edition pins, still has the old function. The lab API builds its logger with `createLogger` from that module (`apps/lab-api/src/app.ts`), and `createLogger` runs every message and every text attribute through `redact()`. This edition's own log lines carry request ids, counts and error messages, never a request body or a CSV row, so no leak is known here; the change closes the gap for any token or key that does reach a message (an error message, for example).
- **Action here:** none now. When the `core-update` pull request for the release that carries it arrives, run `npm ci`, `npm test` and `npm run e2e`, and add that release to this file. Nothing in this edition's code needs to change.

### 2026-10-25: this edition's lab image was renamed (now `img-mo-lab-addon`)

- The lab image is now `docker.io/hybridcloudworks/img-mo-lab-addon` (owner naming convention `img-<short name>-<job>-<type>`), and its tag is the full release tag (`v0.3.1`, not `0.3.1`). The container name on the lab host is unchanged.
- **Reaches this edition? Only the image name.** The release tarball pins, hashes and the `core-update` workflow are unchanged. The Docker OIDC connection must allow this repository to push to the new Docker Hub repository before the next `v*` tag; see `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/deployment/lab-host.md`.

### 2026-10-24: the upstream repository was renamed (now `HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App`)

- The upstream product `saulpatinojr/HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_App` is now `saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App`
  (upstream pull request [68](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/68) updates its own references).
  GitHub redirects the old address, including release downloads, so nothing broke at the moment of the rename.
- **Reaches this edition? Yes, and it is a change here.** `package.json` and `package-lock.json` now name the new address in the two
  `v0.3.1` tarball URLs. The release tag is the same and the `integrity` hashes were not touched, because the files are the
  same files; only the address in front of them changed. `core-update.yml` now looks for releases at the new name
  (`UPSTREAM`); the way it reads the pinned tag and rewrites it does not depend on the repository name. The rest are links
  and descriptions in the documents.
- This edition was renamed on 2026-10-24 from `HCW-AzMigrateOrchestrator_Addon` to `HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn`, to match the upstream App and the other add-ons. GitHub redirects the old address.
- Left as written on purpose: the older changelog entry that records what happened at the time, and the ADR copies, which say
  where they were copied from.
- From upstream `v0.4.0` on (update 2026-10-27), the tarballs' `package.json` files name the new repository address (the upstream assembly script was updated).
  That is metadata only. Nothing to run beyond the usual `core-update` check.
- The old address keeps redirecting only while nobody creates a repository with the old name. Do not reuse it.

### 2026-10-24: documentation, repository protection and CI upstream

| Upstream change | Reaches this edition? | Action here |
|---|---|---|
| [#62](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/62): README, plan, validation record and manifest label brought up to date; adds the rule that asks for entries in this file | No code. Docs only | None. This file exists because of it |
| [#61](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/61): `appliance-image` is a required check on upstream `main` | No. It guards the appliance image, which this edition does not build or ship | None |
| [#60](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/60): the appliance's Terraform `image_ref` has no `:latest` default and must be an exact `@sha256:` digest | **No.** The Terraform root `infrastructure/terraform/appliance-azure` is upstream-only. This edition deploys its own image, `docker.io/hybridcloudworks/img-mo-lab-addon`, by digest through the website's `addons` Ansible role (`docs/deployment/lab-host.md`), and that path is unchanged | None |
| [#59](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/59): pull requests upstream now build, lint (hadolint), scan (Trivy) and start the appliance image | No. Same reason as #61 | None |
| [#58](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/58): documentation drift after the repository split fixed upstream; the ledger and matrix now mark `apps/lab-api`, `apps/lab-web`, `apps/ui-harness`, `docs/demo/*` and `infrastructure/coder` as owned by this edition | Docs only; confirms what this edition owns | None |
| [#57](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/57): a manual administration workflow applies upstream rulesets for `main` and for `v*` tags | **Yes, in effect.** Release tags upstream can no longer be deleted or moved, so the release URLs and integrity hashes pinned here stay valid | Keep pinning by exact tag. Never point the pin at `main` or at a tag that is not a published release |
| [#41](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/41) and [#56](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/56): plain-language rules for talking to the owner in upstream `CLAUDE.md` | No | None |

Published but not changed: the appliance image upstream was **not** published for `v0.3.0` or `v0.3.1` (the `publish-images`
job is skipped while `DOCKERHUB_ENABLED` is not set; upstream ticket [#42](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/42)).
That affects only the enterprise appliance. This edition's own image publishes from this repository.

### 2026-10-18 and 2026-10-19: dependency updates upstream (merged Dependabot pull requests)

| Upstream change | Reaches this edition? | Action here |
|---|---|---|
| [#29](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/29) and [#38](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/38) `@radix-ui/react-dialog` to 1.3.1, [#33](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/33) `@radix-ui/react-tabs` to ^1.2.1, [#37](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/37) `react-dom` to 19.3.1 | **Yes; arrived with upstream `v0.4.0` (update 2026-10-27).** `packages/ui/package.json` now declares `@radix-ui/react-dialog` ^1.3.1, `@radix-ui/react-tabs` ^1.2.1 and a `react-dom` peer of ^19.3.1 (they were ^1.1.6, ^1.1.3 and ^19.0.0 in `v0.3.1`). This edition's lock held dialog 1.1.23 and tabs 1.1.21 before the `v0.4.0` re-lock; it now holds dialog 1.3.1 and tabs 1.2.1. Its `react-dom` is already 19.3.1, which satisfies the new peer | When the `core-update` pull request arrives: run `npm ci`, `npm test` and `npm run e2e`; look at the two places the explorer uses them, the decision-detail dialog (`DecisionDetail`) and the generated-files tabs (`GeneratedFiles`), in the e2e report |
| [#36](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/36) `@azure/msal-browser`, [#35](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/35) dev group, GitHub Actions updates ([#26](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/26), [#27](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/27), [#28](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/28), [#31](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/31), [#40](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/40)) | No. Appliance web app, upstream dev tooling and upstream workflows only | None |
| [#34](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/34): a refreshed Microsoft Learn move-support diff report | No. It is a report under `rules/reports/`, outside the shipped rule corpus; the rules and snapshot (35 rules, 1.0.35) are unchanged | None |

### 2026-10-11: build tooling upstream

| Upstream change | Reaches this edition? | Action here |
|---|---|---|
| [#23](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/23): upstream builds with TypeScript 7, Vite 8 and `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6 | **Yes; arrived with upstream `v0.4.0` (update 2026-10-27).** The published `dist/` and type declarations are compiled by the release workflow, and the upstream root `package.json` moved from TypeScript ^5.6.3 (`v0.3.1`) to ^7.0.2 (`v0.4.0`). `v0.3.1` was built before this change | Same checks as above; also run `npm run typecheck` here, since this edition's code consumes the published `.d.ts` files |
| [#24](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/24) and [#25](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/pull/25): upstream workflow credentials and README | No | None |

### 2026-10-11: release `v0.3.1` (adopted here then; since replaced by `v0.4.0` and `v0.4.1`)

`v0.3.1`: the questionnaire keeps focus, destination region is a select, and portal exports without a RESOURCE ID column derive ids from RESOURCE LINK
(upstream `CHANGELOG.md`, section 0.3.1). This edition adopted it (`package.json` pin and `package-lock.json` integrity at the time).

## Upstream decisions that affected this edition (all closed as of 2026-10-27)

All five are closed upstream (#42 on 2026-10-26, #44, #46 and #52 on 2026-10-25, #53 on 2026-10-26; UTC dates from the tickets). None of them blocked this edition.

| Upstream ticket | What it decides | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| [#42](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/42) | Whether and when the enterprise appliance image is published to Docker Hub | None for the pane. Closed: the appliance image is published from a `v*` tag; `v0.4.0` and `v0.4.1` have one, `v0.3.x` has none |
| [#52](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/52) | Release hygiene: per-job permissions, one job creating the release, an SBOM, a post-release check of the tarballs | Closed. The tag half is done (see #57 above). Two SBOM files (`amo-cli-<version>.cdx.json` and `hybridcloudworks-migration-packages-<version>.cdx.json`) are now published next to the tarballs on `v0.4.0` and `v0.4.1`; the URLs this edition pins did not change |
| [#44](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/44) | Whether the appliance API gets an origin allow-list or is documented as same-origin only | None. This edition has its own exact-origin CORS and must not copy any wildcard |
| [#46](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/46) | Role model for the appliance's Entra sign-in | None. This edition has no sign-in by design |
| [#53](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App/issues/53) | Appliance Terraform hardening (subnet firewalls, backup, private endpoint) | None. Upstream infrastructure only |

## Known documentation errors outside this repository

- The GitHub Release notes for this edition's `v0.3.1` say it adopts "`@amo/migration-core` and `@amo/report-templates`". The
  packages are `@hybridcloudworks/migration-core` and `@hybridcloudworks/migration-ui`. Release notes are published text, so this
  was not edited; an owner can correct it on the [release page](https://github.com/saulpatinojr/HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn/releases/tag/v0.3.1).
